# Week 13: E-Commerce Back End ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This week's challenge asked us to finish the back-end of an ecommerce application, allowing a developer to execute CRUD methods on various parts of the applications database.

The general completion of the code was simple by itself. The biggest hurdles for me were actually interpreting the code. With the codebase now being compartmentalized for clarity of usage, it's become harder for me to keep track of how data is being communicated between all the difference JavaScripts. In addition, while most other languages did not have too many restrictions on syntax, working with JSON objects through Insomnia posed a small speed-bump, as I had not expected the syntax to be that specific.

At the very least, it's begun to expose my struggles with interpreting codebases organized in a similar manner. Probably something I should work on.
